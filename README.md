# Module 3 Final Project


## Introduction

Potable water resource is key life necessity. In Tanzania, many areas depends on water pumps for living support. It is very important to learn the functionality status of water pumps and what are potential factors that might this.

This project intends to look at different physical, geographical, and social features related to the water pump. 


## Questions and Answers

- Would water and pump's mechanical features affect the operation of the pump?
- Are there any geospatial distribution patterns?
- Are there any particular characteristics standing out that can affect the functional status of the pump?

## Models & Evaluation
A few different types of machine learning models were utilized to study the functional status of the water pumps, including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- XGBoost
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy score and was further tune and evaluated. 

## Some Conclusions

Based on the EDA and model, some important feature include:
- Distance to the closest town
- Population (which infers further usage)
- Height (altitude)
- Total Static head
- Extraction type
- Dry quantity
